# Uber-Trips-Analysis
In early 2017, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) released a dataset detailing Uber's ridership between September 2014 and August 2015, distinct from previously explored data sets. This project aimed to comprehensively analyze Uber's growth in NYC during this period, employing robust data cleaning techniques to ensure integrity. Through meticulous processing, key metrics such as average speed and estimated revenue were calculated, and insightful trends were visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Leveraging machine learning, specifically linear regression, trip revenue was predicted, offering deeper insights into Uber's operations. The project further sought to characterize demand patterns, estimate the value of the NYC market for Uber, and provide predictions for future growth beyond 2015, culminating in a holistic understanding of Uber's impact and potential in the city.
